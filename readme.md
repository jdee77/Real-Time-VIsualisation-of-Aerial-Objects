I have worked on this project titled "REAL TIME VISUALISATION OF AERIAL OBJECTS" as part of my Summer Internship at Integrated Test Range, Defence Research and Development Organisation, chandipur, Balasore.

The project titled REAL TIMEVISUALISATION OF AERIAL OBJECTS aims to develop a 
convenient and efficient interface for the various clients of ITR, DRDO and other department 
concern, in order to provide all the required types of display. The primary objective is to make 
this application user friendly, and enable user handle it with minimal knowledge technical 
understanding of the software and processes involved. Functionality for handling and plotting 
up to 100 sensors and 5 Aerial Vehicle data received simultaneously from two servers, either 
in unicast or multicast mode, maintaining minimal latency. Flexibility for configuring and 
saving the settings to achieve the best display for each mission must be provided while making 
use of the latest graph plotting technologies currently existing to provide certain additional 
facilities as per the clientâ€™s needs.
